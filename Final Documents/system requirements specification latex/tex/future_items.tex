\subsection{Upgraded video capabilities}
\subsubsection{Description}
The ideal video capabilities utilized by the system are 2160p (or greater) at 60+fps.
\subsubsection{Source}
HTC Vive 
\subsubsection{Constraints}
These conditions are not currently achievable without high-end hardware components, each of which may run multiple times beyond our system budget.
\subsubsection{Standards}
The modern virtual reality standard operates ideally at 2160p with a 90Hz refresh rate. These headsets are first-generation models, and future models are expected to extend hardware capabilities exponentially. In order to achieve these standards, extremely low latency must be achieved wirelessly while transmitting and processing gigabytes of data over the air.
