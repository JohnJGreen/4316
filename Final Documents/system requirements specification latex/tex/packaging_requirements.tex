CSE Senior Design project specifications
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Camera settings do not need calibration with each startup. Cameras do not auto focus, but maintain the specified focal point between systems. Virtual reality directive software calibrates camera frame rates. 
\subsubsection{Standards}
None
\subsubsection{Priority}
High Priority: Essential to user-friendly operation of the target system.

\subsection{The camera rig shall come pre-assembled}
