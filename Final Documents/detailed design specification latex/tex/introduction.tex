The project utilizes a stereo camera paired with an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. The video is streamed into the Oculus as a stereo image allowing a better sense of depth than a traditional camera setup.  The stereo camera is mounted to a custom 3-axis gimbal controlled by the head tracking in the Oculus headset. The gimbal stabilizes the stereo camera to match the angle of the Oculus headset. This stabilization on set angles allows the mounting of the gimbal on mobile or stationary platforms.

The Camera System, including the gimbal and motor controller, is detailed in section three. The encoding and rendering of the video is contained in the Processing System. The head tracking data signal translation falls into the realm of the Processing System and is covered in section four. Section five relates to the Virtual Reality System. The Virtual Reality System displays the rendered video and provides head tracking data.
