The Virtual Reality System is focused on delivering real-time video and tracking of the head movement on the virtual reality headset. This system contains the stereo display subsystem and the head tracking subsystem. The stereo display subsystem will interact with the video rendering subsystem, while the head tracking subsystem will interact with the angular translation subsystem.
