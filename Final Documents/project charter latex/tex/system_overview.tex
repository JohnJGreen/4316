The project will be a custom stereoscopic camera mounted on a gimbal with 3D movement capabilites (pitch, yaw, roll). The movement of the cameras will be one-to-one with the movement of a virtual reality headset on the user. Minimal computation will be used onboard the actual unit, the majority of processing will be accomplished by the computer running the virtual reality set. Camera focal points will be preset and calibrated to predetermined focal distance. Initial versions of the system will use a wire tether for data transfer between the camera unit and processing unit.
