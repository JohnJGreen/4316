Similar to the awareness the public had of augmented reality before Pok\'{e}mon Go increased the awareness, virtual reality was around for many decades. Nowadays, virtual reality has been increasing the awareness of the public because commercial products are being developed and sold. A head mounted display is usually used to experience the virtual world. In a recent development of a virtual reality camera, the Orah 4i will make it possible to live stream video footage to a head mounted display or to a mobile phone that can offer virtual reality options. The Orah 4i has four image sensors with fisheye lenses to be able to capture an output with a 360\textdegree field of view. A stitching box is included with the product to live stream the video footage with high quality. Even before the development of Orah 4i, companies sold 360\textdegree cameras that supported virtual reality such as Nokia, Samsung, and Vuze. Another camera besides the 360\textdegree field of view in the market is the stereo camera. Stereo cameras capture the depth of the three-dimensional images taken from the camera. Unlike the 360\textdegree cameras, stereo cameras have a field of view less than 180\textdegree, and it has two image sensors. The ZED camera is an example of a stereo camera where the depth is captured in the images.
